## Introduction
## Cleaning and EDA
### Data Cleaning

#### 1. We **left merged** the recipes and interactions datasets together and then **filled all ratings of 0 with** `np.nan`. 

- This is because NaN values are typically excluded from statistical calculations such as mean, median, and standard deviation. By converting 0 ratings to NaN, we can ensure that these calculations accurately represent the ratings provided by users, without distorting the statistical measures due to explicit low ratings.

#### 2. We **dropped the duplicate id column**, which is `recipe_id`. 

- As after merging two data frames, which are ratings and interactions, both dataframes have the recipe id columns, which are unneccessary to have two columns. So we delete one to save some time when doing the analysis. 

#### 3. We found the **averate rating per recipe** as a Series and then added this Series to the merged dataframe. 

- As for the same recipe, it may have several rows (i.e receive more than one ratings and reviews), so by getting a average rating of each recipe, we can get a single representative rating that indicates overall sentiment or perceived quality of each recipe. 

#### 4. We cleaned the `nutrition` column, from values that are list-look-like strings to actual lists, and then we created a separate column for every unique value in the `nutrition` lists, so now each value in list of the `nutrition` column has its own column titled `calories`, `total fat`, `sugar`, `sodium`, `protein`, `saturated fat`, and `carbohydrates`.  

- By giving a separate column for each type of nutrient, it makes our analysis process faster and easier for inidivual analysis of each nutrient and also filtering like filter and sort recipes based on specific nutritional criteria. 

#### 5. Using the same procedure, we also clean the `tags`, `steps`,  and `ingredients` columns into actual lists, which are all originally list-look-like strings. 

#### 6. We dropped the `review` column. 

- It doesn't have much usage. 

#### 7. We removed duplicate rows of unique recipe and only saved one row for each recipe. 

- As we have gained the data of average ratings for each recipe, and we can perform analysis on the average ratings for each recipe instead of the several ratings coming from severl users.

### Univariate Analysis

### Bivariate Analysis

### Interesting Aggregates


## Assessment of Missingness
### NMAR Analysis

The column `description` is NMAR, because users might have chosen not to provide a description for certain recipes or left it blank intentionally. In order to further investigate potentially make it Missing at Random (MAR), additional data we would like to obtain can be user demographics, such as age, gender, or location, so we can further investigate whether the missingness of description depend on these factors or not. For example, if older users tend to not writing description when rating a recipe, it will change the missingness mechansim of `description` to MAR. 

### Missingness Dependency

#### 1. depends on

The missingness of column `average rating` **does** depend on the column `n_steps`. 

##### Null hypothesis: 
the distribution of `n_steps` is the same when column `average rating` is missing and when column `average rating` is not missing. 

##### Alternative hypothesis: 
the distribution of `n_steps` is not the same when column `average rating` is missing and when column `average rating` is not missing.
 
##### Distribution of column `n_steps` when column `average rating` is missing and not missing

##### test statistic

We choose k-s as our test statistic 

##### Result interpretation: 

After doing 500 times of shuffling of the n_steps column and calculates the k-s test statistic, we get a p-value of 0.0, indicating that we should reject the null hypothesis under any siginificance value. We can draw the conclusion that  column `average rating` is MAR dependent on `n_steps`.

#### 2. does not depend on

The missingness of column `average rating` **does not** depend on the column `sodium`. 

##### Null hypothesis: 
the distribution of `sodium` is the same when column `average rating` is missing and when column `average rating` is not missing.

##### Alternative hypothesis: 
the distribution of `sodium` is not the same when column `average rating` is missing and when column `average rating` is not missing.

##### Distribution of column `sodium` when column `average rating` is missing and not missing

<iframe src="assets/sodium_missingness_1st.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

##### Result interpretation: 

After doing 1000 times of shuffling of the sodium column and calculates the k-s test statistic, we get a p-value of 0.128, indicating that we fail to reject the null hypothesis under siginificance value of 0.05. We can draw the conclusion that the missingness of column `average rating` does not depend on column `sodium`.

## Hypothesis Testing

#### 1. Clarification
We categorize the recipes into two different groups, using a threshold that is the mean average-rating of all recipes, which is around 4.6 
high average-rating: recipes with average-rating that is higher than 4.6
low average-rating: recipes with average-rating that is lower than 4.6

#### 2. Null Hypothesis
In the population, cooking time (minutes) of recipes with a high average-rating and recipes with a low average-rating have the same distribution, and the observed differences in our samples are due to random chance.


#### 3. Alternative Hypothesis
In the population, recipes with a high average-rating have shorter cooking time than recipes with low average-rating. The observed difference in our samples cannot be explained by random chance alone.

#### 4. Test Statistic
mean minutes of high average-rating recipes - mean minutes of low average-rating recipes

#### 5. Significance Level
0.05

#### 6. P-value
0.0
 
#### 7.Justification
